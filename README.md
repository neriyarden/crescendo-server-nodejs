# Crescendo

Where Artists and Fans Meet.

## Project Description:
Crescendo is a social-platform for musicians to advertize their upcoming **Events** and **Requests**, and for fans to find their local events lineup and to vote for requests.

### What's an Event?
An event is simply as it sounds, a live show, a music concert, a gathering. Events have time, date & location, as well as a production and a venue already booked.

### What's a Request?
In contrary to an Event, A Request has no planned time & date (yet), and it may or may not be a real event in the future.
A Request is for artists to declare their intention to perform in a certain city, and see if there is a demand for it.

#### How does it work? 
An artist can publish a request in, let's say Haifa. Before the request is published, the artist decides on the 'cap' count.
After the request is published, other users can vote for it, one vote per user per request.
Once the request votes reach the cap, the artist recieves a message and he can make it into a real event on Crescendo.
